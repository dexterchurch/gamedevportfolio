## **Group Project:**

**Title:** Rusted Ring

**Description:** In a post-apocalyptic world where nothing is as it seems, you are a scavenger, uncovering the mystery behind the collapse of human civilizationâ€¦ Explore vast, ruined landscapes, fight off rival factions and beasts, and piece together cryptic clues. It is unique because of its blend of dystopian and 16-bit game style, an enticing mix that will keep players engaged and interested.
